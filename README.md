fadeSwitch
==========

Turns ugly page loading transitions into fadeIn/fadeOut transitions using jQuery.

Just include <a href="fadeSwitch/fadeSwitch.js">fadeSwitch.js</a> on every html page you'd like to have fade transitions. It's dependent on jQuery so make sure that's included before <a href="fadeSwitch/fadeSwitch.js">fadeSwitch.js</a>. Currently it works for links but not form submissions.
